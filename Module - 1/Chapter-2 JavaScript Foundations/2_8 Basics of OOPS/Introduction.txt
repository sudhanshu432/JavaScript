Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects, providing a clear and intuitive 
way to model real-world entities and behaviors in software development. By encapsulating data and methods, OOP promotes modularity, 
abstraction, and extensibility, making it a fundamental concept in modern programming.

Focus: OOPs and ES Classes, `this` keyword, JavaScript Prototype and Inheritance, extends keyword

Prerequisites: VS Code IDE with Node.js installed, JavaScript Basics



Theme

A team of developers was working on an e-commerce website project and wanted to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable solution that would meet 
their client's requirements. They were familiar with Object-Oriented Programming. Still, they were using a different programming language and needed 
to become more familiar with the latest features of JavaScript, such as ES Classes.

By combining the power of JavaScript OOP, and ES Classes, the team was able to create a robust, flexible, and maintainable solution. 
They used ES Classes to define objects and classes clearly. The result was a well-crafted website that impressed their client.
