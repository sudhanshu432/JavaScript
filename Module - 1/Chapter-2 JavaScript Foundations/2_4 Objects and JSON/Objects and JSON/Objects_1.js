// In javaScript everything is an object
//  Any thing is javaScript which starts with '{' and end with '}' are objects
// Console is an object
// Difference b/W object based and oriented programming 
let person = {
    myName : "Sudhanshu",
    age : 22
};

let person1 = ['Sudhanshu', '22'];
// Difference b/w array and object
// Ans: object stores key value pairs and array not offer this functionality
